A few minutes is a time frame big enough to make progress.

# Types of Work

::left::

### Shallow Work


- Simple tasks requiring almost no training
- Fast-paced, easily accomplished
- If highly trained, moderate tasks become simple


::right::

### Deep Work


- Moderate to hard tasks
- Push our cognitive abilities
- Produce substantial value or impact
- We grow and learn by doing them

# Task Collection Setup

<div class="text-lg mt-4">
Create a private board for your tasks:
</div>


1. Create a private Monday.com board
2. Invite `C3PO Service account` as contributor
3. Add these columns:
   - **Work** - Deep / Shallow (Autofill with AI!)
   - **Snooze** - Date | Date + Time
   - **Snooze details** - Text (Optional)

# Slack Integration


1. Create a private Slack channel

2. Invite `@n8n BigBrain Agent`

3. Duplicate the n8n trigger flow template

4. Set flow config (treat the sub workflow as npm)



<div class="mt-6 text-lg monday-text-purple">
Now you have automated task reminders flowing between Monday and Slack!

# Calendar Philosophy


- **Reflect your daily routine** - both work and personal

- **Block time for deep work** - Don't let it get squeezed out

- **Keep empty slots** - So people can book time with you

- **Dedicated free time slots** - Interview slots, office hours

- **Respect personal time** - It's non-negotiable

# Each day should have a slot for the daily MIT

<div class="text-xl mt-6">

- Most people are most effective in the **mornings**

- Find the MIT slots that work with **your schedule**

# Why We Don't Say No

<v-clicks>

- **Fear of Disappointment** - Worry about letting others down

- **Fear of Conflict** - Reluctance to create tension

- **Fear of Incompetence** - Anxiety that refusing = inability to handle task

- **Fear of Exclusion (FOMO)** - Concern about missing growth opportunities

- **Fear of Perception** - Worry about being labeled "uncooperative"

</v-clicks>

<!--
Some of the reasons we normally avoid saying no when we actually should

* we might try to avoid letting people down

* sometimes we will try to avoid conflict

* we might fear that saying no might come across as incompetent in the task scope

* Sometimes something sounds interesting, to good to miss and not be part of

* or maybe just coming across as the one that doesn't help

# When It's OK to Say No

<v-clicks>

- **When you're at capacity** - Overcommitting leads to under-delivering. A clear "No" or "Not now" is better than a broken promise later.

- **When ROI is low** - True competence is knowing where you add the most value.

- **When it's "interesting" but not strategic** - Curiosity is not a business goal. If it doesn't align with OKRs, it's a distraction.

- **When it falls outside your core role** - Trying to do everything dilutes your effectiveness.

</v-clicks>

<!--
But sometimes it is actually OK to say no

* it's better to reflect load and balance with urgency - if you are at capacity and an urgent task comes in that you are the expert on, then use the tools we learned to prioritize, but assuming it is not urgent - either schedule or say no

* if your participation in the task does not produce real value, then its just noise, for all parties involved

* Now this can go both ways. Interesting might not be enough for CTA in the context of the task but sometimes this might lead to other better tasks - so with a pinch of salt

*

# The S3 Rule

<div class="text-xl mt-6">
<strong>Schedule</strong> once, <strong>Snooze</strong> twice - then either delegate or do

- Allocating time is great, but expect the  unexpected - steals time slots

- That's unavoidable - but always **reschedule**

- If you keep putting out fires, your ability to self-manage diminishes

<div class="mt-6 p-4 monday-bg-purple-light rounded-lg">
Each time you reschedule, re-evaluate importance & urgency
</div>

</v-click>

<!--
If you snooze too many times, it probably means that it's not important (so delegate or delete) or that as we snooze the importance or urgency is increased

# Daily Focus

<div class="text-lg mt-4">
If you have multiple deep tasks that must progress in parallel
</div>

<v-click>

<div class="mt-4 p-4 monday-bg-purple-light rounded-lg">
Define a <strong>daily focus</strong> - each day the MIT is a different deep task

<v-click>

<div class="mt-6">

| Day | Focus |
|-----|-------|
| Sunday | Last Week Catch-up |
| Monday | ADRs |
| Tuesday | 1:1 meetings |
| Wednesday | Mentorship |
| Thursday | Publications |

</div>

</v-click>

<!--
so if I have, lets say, a blog post i need to work on, it'll always be on the Thursday MIT slot - unless it somehow becomes urgent
